# ClipConvert: Technical Overview

This document provides a technical overview of ClipConvert's architecture, design patterns, and implementation details. It's intended for developers who want to understand the codebase or contribute to the project.

## Architecture Overview

ClipConvert follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

│   ├── ViewModels/        # MVVM view models
│   └── Views/             # XAML views
```

## Design Patterns

ClipConvert implements several design patterns to ensure maintainability and extensibility:

### Strategy Pattern

The conversion system uses the Strategy pattern to allow different conversion algorithms to be selected at runtime:

- `IConverter` interface defines the conversion contract
- `BaseConverter` provides common functionality
- Concrete converter classes implement specific format conversions
- `ConversionContext` manages the selected strategy

### Factory Pattern

The `ConverterFactory` implements a factory pattern to create appropriate converters:

- Centralizes converter creation logic
- Supports lazy loading of converters
- Maintains a registry of available converters
- Provides format discovery capabilities

### Dependency Injection

The application uses Microsoft's DI container for service resolution:

- Services are registered in `App.xaml.cs`
- Constructor injection is used throughout
- Promotes testability and loose coupling

### MVVM Pattern

The UI follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern:

- Views are defined in XAML
- ViewModels expose properties and commands
- Models represent the data
- `RelayCommand` implements `ICommand` for binding

## Key Components

### Clipboard Integration

The `ClipboardService` provides clipboard functionality:

- Monitors clipboard for file content
- Handles file data extraction
- Manages temporary files
- Optimizes memory usage with `RecyclableMemoryStreamManager`

### Hotkey System

The `HotkeyService` manages global hotkeys:

- Registers system-wide hotkeys
- Handles hotkey events
- Provides customization options

### Conversion Pipeline

The conversion process follows these steps:

1. File is detected in clipboard
2. File format is identified by `FileTypeDetector`
3. Available target formats are determined
4. User selects target format
5. `ConverterFactory` creates appropriate converter
6. `ConversionContext` executes the conversion
7. Result is placed in clipboard

### Lazy Loading

ClipConvert uses lazy loading to minimize resource usage:

- Converters are loaded only when needed
- UI components are created on demand
- Resources are released when no longer needed

## Threading Model

The application uses a mix of UI and background threading:

- UI operations run on the main thread
- Conversions run on background threads
- `async/await` pattern is used for asynchronous operations
- Thread synchronization is handled by the dispatcher

## Memory Management

Special attention is paid to efficient memory usage:

- `RecyclableMemoryStreamManager` for stream pooling
- Proper disposal of resources with `IDisposable`
- Careful handling of large files
- Explicit cleanup of temporary files

## Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

- Structured exception handling
- Detailed logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation

## Logging System

The `Logger` class provides logging capabilities:

- Multiple log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
- File-based logging
- Timestamp and context information
- Exception details capture

## Configuration

User settings are managed by the `SettingsService`:

- JSON-based configuration
- User preferences persistence
- Default settings provision
- Settings validation

## Extension Points

ClipConvert is designed to be extensible in several ways:

### Adding New Converters

To add a new converter:

1. Create a new class that inherits from `BaseConverter`
2. Implement the required methods
3. Register the converter type in `App.xaml.cs`

Example:
```csharp
public class NewFormatConverter : BaseConverter
{
    public override string SourceFormat => "sourceformat";
    public override string TargetFormat => "targetformat";

    public override async Task ConvertAsync(Stream sourceStream, Stream targetStream)
    {
        // Conversion implementation
    }
}

// In App.xaml.cs
factory.RegisterConverterType(typeof(NewFormatConverter));
```

### UI Customization

The UI can be extended by:

- Adding new views in XAML
- Creating new ViewModels
- Registering them in the DI container

### Service Extensions

Additional services can be added by:

1. Defining an interface in the `Interfaces` namespace
2. Implementing the service
3. Registering it in the DI container

## Performance Considerations

ClipConvert is optimized for performance in several ways:

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient stream handling
- Memory pooling
- Background processing
- Minimal UI updates

## Testing

The codebase is designed to be testable:

- Interfaces for all major components
- Dependency injection for mocking
- Separation of concerns
- Minimal dependencies between components

## Build and Deployment

ClipConvert uses standard .NET build processes:

- MSBuild for compilation
- NuGet for package management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (planned)
- ClickOnce for deployment

## Future Technical Directions

Planned technical improvements include:

- Plugin system for third-party converters
- Enhanced memory management for very large files
- Multi-file batch processing
- Additional format support
- Performance optimizations
